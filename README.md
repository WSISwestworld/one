# What we design is a web-based system for our client who is an NGO. The system will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and jQuery. Through our system, we are helping the people who are facing problems related to the water supply. Basically what we are doing is we gather information related to water supply issues in different areas and filter them accordingly, so that we can make necessary plans to confirm, collect donations and implement projects. The people in the areas with water supply problems will be benefited through this system.
